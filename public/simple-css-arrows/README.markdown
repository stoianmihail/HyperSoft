Single-class CSS arrows that can be manipulated by building up the class name using different characteristic tags.  No need to remember long CSS names or have multiple classes for a single HTML element - these arrow characteristics are order-agnostic.  For example it doesn't matter if you tell the arrow to be a certain color before or after you tell it what direction to point, both with have the same results.
